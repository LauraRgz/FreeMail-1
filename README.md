# FreeMail

FreeMail is a desktop client mail developed to have all your mails in one application. Despite being a prototype, it has enough functionality to provide basic actions in different email accounts.

With FreeMail we want to make a difference. We have developed the application under GPLv3 license. This enables other users to change everything and customise the product, creating a collaborative environment.
